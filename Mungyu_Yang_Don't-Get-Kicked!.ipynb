The auto community calls these unfortunate purchases \"kicks\".\n\nKicked cars often result when there are tampered odometers, mechanical issues the dealer is not able to address, issues with getting the vehicle title from the seller, or some other unforeseen problem. Kick cars can be very costly to dealers after transportation cost, throw-away repair work, and market losses in reselling the vehicle.\n\nModelers who can figure out which cars have a higher risk of being kick can provide real value to dealerships trying to provide the best inventory selection possible to their customers.\n\nThe challenge of this competition is to predict if the car purchased at the Auction is a Kick (bad buy).\n\nReference - faysal, Will Adams, Will Cukierski.
